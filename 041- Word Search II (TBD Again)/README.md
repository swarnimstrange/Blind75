<h3> Problem </h3>
Given a 2-D grid of characters board and a list of strings words, return all words that are present in the grid.

For a word to be present it must be possible to form the word with a path in the board with horizontally or vertically neighboring cells. The same cell may not be used more than once in a word.

Example 1:

<pre>
    <img alt="" src="https://imagedelivery.net/CLfkmk9Wzy8_9HRyug4EVA/06435c8e-bac3-49f5-5df7-77fd5dd42800/public">
    Input:
    board = [
    ["a","b","c","d"],
    ["s","a","a","t"],
    ["a","c","k","e"],
    ["a","c","d","n"]
    ],
    words = ["bat","cat","back","backend","stack"]

    Output: ["cat","back","backend"]
